<p>Learn how to integrate APIs, fetch data from a public API, and use it in your Flutter app. by Abhishek Doshi </p>
<p>There are a few steps that we can follow to easily integrate an API into our Flutter app:</p>

* Step 1: Get the API URL and endpoints.
* Step 2: Add relevant packages into the app (http, dio, chopper, etc.).
* Step 3: Create a constant file that stores URLs and endpoints.
* Step 4: Create a model class to parse the JSON.
* Step 5: Create a file that handles the API call, and write specific methods to fetch and parse data.
* Step 6: Use the data in your app.
